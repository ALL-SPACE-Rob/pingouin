Code
----
- Homogenize column names in output dataframe
- CI95% in a single column for linear/logistic regression
- pairwise_ttests should accept two within or two between factors
- Do not compute BF10 in too large datasets (scipy.integrate.quad crashes)
- Add Hotelling test
- pingouin.plotting module (e.g. circular, repeated measures corr, covariance)?
- Add more circular stats
